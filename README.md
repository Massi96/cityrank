# CityRank

CityRank is a project created for the subject "TECHNIQUES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF OPEN DATA". 
CityRank was born from idea of draw up a ranking about the livability of the five most populous Italian provinces, that are: 

* Palermo 
* Napoli 
* Roma 
* Milano  
* Torino

The index is calculated considering some factors that affect everyday life
in the city, for example average income, recycling or the crime rate. The
final data are displayed on a map showing the provinces with their
respective index and informations such as schools, hospitals and libraries.
